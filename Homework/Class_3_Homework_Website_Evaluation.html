        <div>
	        <h1 id="website1"><a href="//www.imgur.com">Imgur</a></h1>
	        <h3>1a</h3>
	        <p>Black / Grey with bright green accents</p>
	        <h3>1b</h3>
	        <p>I think it is unique and is dark to be more usable at night as you are wasting time in the evening.</p>
	        <h3>2a</h3>
	        <p>13-30 year olds looking to waste time.</p>
	        <h3>2b</h3>
	        <p>It's more complicated than it needs to be and that extra clutter can be decoded younger users.</p>
	        <h3>3a</h3>
	        <p>Most users are merely consuming content.</p>
	        <h3>3b</h3>
	        <p>It's the best part of the website. Posting and keeping track of images / galleries is really quite bad.</p>
	        <h3>4</h3>
	        <p>I think it is good enough. mobile especially is quite good. Things banner ads and complications to management of images are the biggest weak spot to me.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
	        <h1 id="website2"><a href="//www.theverge.com">The Verge</a></h1>
	        <h3>1a</h3>
	        <p>White and black for content, but a pervasive orange and purple color for banners, branding and accents.</p>
	        <h3>1b</h3>
	        <p>Purple and orange has been pretty popular for the past few years, but the information is mostly high contrast black / white.</p>
	        <h3>2a</h3>
	        <p>People skimming headlines and thumbnails for information.</p>
	        <h3>2b</h3>
	        <p>Very editorial / news oriented.</p>
	        <h3>3a</h3>
	        <p>Skimming for news and information.</p>
	        <h3>3b</h3>
	        <p>It does for me!</p>
	        <h3>4</h3>
	        <p>It can become a bit too much at times, but my biggest complaint is how slow and bloated it can be, due to styles but also due to trackers and ads.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
	        <h1 id="website3"><a href="//www.artstation.com">Art Station</a></h1>
	        <h3>1a</h3>
	        <p>Black, Dark Grey and Light blue.</p>
	        <h3>1b</h3>
	        <p>The dark primary colors help the art to stand out without blasting your eyes with white.</p>
	        <h3>2a</h3>
	        <p>Entertainment industry artist / recruiters.</p>
	        <h3>2b</h3>
	        <p>I think it is practical and "high tech" looking which matches most of the art content.</p>
	        <h3>3a</h3>
	        <p>Finding art and making connections.</p>
	        <h3>3b</h3>
	        <p>I think it is very focused.</p>
	        <h3>4</h3>
	        <p>Yes</p>
